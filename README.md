# NFT Secondary Marketplace

### What is being built 🔧     

A secondary NFT marketplace. This project is attempting to give users a way to invest in  artist and NFTs. We create NFT-backed tokens by implementing the
'ERC-1155' standard and allow users to invest (purchase, hold, and swap) tokens based on an artist uploaded NFT. 
    

### Why are we building it 🧑‍🔧👨‍🔧

Technically this project is being built for a graded school project, however this a project we are passionate and plan on working to make this a project that can bring in real-world value into the DeFi space. So the sky is the limit!
